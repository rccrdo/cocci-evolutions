This tool automates the task of applying a set of semantic patches
using coccinelle (http://coccinelle.lip6.fr/). This is really just a
collection of semantic patches and a wrapper to invoke
coccinelle. Needless to say, you should always check the results.

At this point in time, only local git repositories are supported and
there is only a small set of semantic patches to help porting Gtk+ 2
applications to Gtk+ 3.
